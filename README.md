## About Me

Hello all, I am Pierre Despereaux and I am a Skyrim modder and Wabbajack modlist author. In the past I have focused mainly on on item integration mods such as Beyond Skyrim in Skyrim - An Integration Mod and Pirate's Life for Me - A Creation Club Integration Mod but I have recently moved on to more ambitious and complicated projects. Right now I am working on Asya'la the Nordic Khajiit - A Fully Voiced Follower mod alongside my wife, Cora Despereaux. I can't wait to share the finished project with you all!

In addition to my mods I also curate the Keizaal Wabbajack modlist. It is a simple modlist that seeks to enhance and expand on Skyrim without compromising Bethesdaâ€™s original vision that we all fell in love with back in 2011. If you're interested in learning more Keizaal be sure to visit the Wabbajack Discord server.
