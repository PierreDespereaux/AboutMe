# About Me

Hello all, my name is Pierre Despereaux and I am a Skyrim modder and Wabbajack modlist author. In the past I have focused mainly on on item integration mods such as [Morrowind Threads - A Creation Club Integration Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45352) and [Pirate's Life for Me - A Creation Club Integration Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35163) but I have recently moved on to more ambitious and complicated projects. Right now I am working on [Asya'la the Nordic Khajiit - A Fully Voiced Follower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbU1ubNYZbo) alongside my wife, Cora Despereaux. I can't wait to share the finished project with you all!

In addition to my mods I also curate the [Keizaal](https://pierredespereaux.github.io/Keizaal/) Wabbajack modlist. It is a simple modlist that seeks to enhance and expand on Skyrim without compromising Bethesda’s original vision that we all fell in love with back in 2011. If you're interested in learning more Keizaal be sure to visit the [Wabbajack](https://discord.com/invite/wabbajack) Discord server.

## My Mods

[![Knight%20of%20the%20North.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreDespereaux/PierreDespereaux/master/assets/images/banners/Knight%20of%20the%20North.png)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45869)

The Creation Club's Relics of the Crusader quest is very underwhelming and disappointing for such important artifacts. I have attempted to overhaul the quest to be more interesting and immersive.

[![Pit%20Fighter%20Revamped.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreDespereaux/PierreDespereaux/master/assets/images/banners/Pit%20Fighter%20Revamped.png)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42340)

![xymDXEI.png](https://i.imgur.com/xymDXEI.png)

Faction - Pit Fighter - Revamped is a mod that seeks to fix issues and expand upon the excellent Faction - Pit Fighter mod by ThirteenOranges.

![Integration%20Series.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreDespereaux/PierreDespereaux/master/assets/images/banners/Integration%20Series.png)

[![Morrowind%20Threads.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreDespereaux/PierreDespereaux/master/assets/images/banners/Morrowind%20Threads.png)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45352)

![i1Q87Su.png](https://i.imgur.com/i1Q87Su.png) ![xymDXEI.png](https://i.imgur.com/xymDXEI.png)

The Creation Club has a beautiful set of Netch Leather Armor, but it isn't integrated the best into the base game. I have taken it upon myself to try and integrate it in a sensible fashion and make it accessible to use at all levels.

[![Thwack!.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreDespereaux/PierreDespereaux/master/assets/images/banners/Thwack!.png)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42653/)

![i1Q87Su.png](https://i.imgur.com/i1Q87Su.png) ![xymDXEI.png](https://i.imgur.com/xymDXEI.png)

The Creation Club is home to some great new crossbows, however, they are integrated extremely poorly into the base game. This mod seeks to rectify that.

[![Pirate's%20Life%20for%20Me.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreDespereaux/PierreDespereaux/master/assets/images/banners/Pirate's%20Life%20for%20Me.png)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35163)

![i1Q87Su.png](https://i.imgur.com/i1Q87Su.png) ![xymDXEI.png](https://i.imgur.com/xymDXEI.png)

Dead Man's Dread adds a lot of great assets geared towards the nautically minded but the only place you can find them is in one small location added by the Creation. Now you can see the new items logically placed across Skyrim on and around sailors and pirates!

[![The%20Vigilants'%20New%20Clothes.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreDespereaux/PierreDespereaux/master/assets/images/banners/The%20Vigilants'%20New%20Clothes.png)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31991)

![i1Q87Su.png](https://i.imgur.com/i1Q87Su.png) ![xymDXEI.png](https://i.imgur.com/xymDXEI.png)

The Vigil Enforcer Set adds some really neat Vigilant of Stendarr and Silver Hand armor sets to the game... but those factions don't use them! Well, now they do.

![New%20Items.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreDespereaux/PierreDespereaux/master/assets/images/banners/New%20Items.png)

[![Ancient%20Nord%20Stalhrim.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreDespereaux/PierreDespereaux/master/assets/images/banners/Ancient%20Nord%20Stalhrim.png)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48756)

![i1Q87Su.png](https://i.imgur.com/i1Q87Su.png) ![xymDXEI.png](https://i.imgur.com/xymDXEI.png)

I have always been annoyed that high-level Draugr use Ebony weapons. With the help of my buddy opusGlass and jboyd4 we have made a new variant of Ancient Nord weapon that is more suiting for the draugr the walk Skyrim's crypts: Ancient Stalhrim!

[![Tale%20of%20Two%20Mers.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreDespereaux/PierreDespereaux/master/assets/images/banners/Tale%20of%20Two%20Mers.png)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43074)

![i1Q87Su.png](https://i.imgur.com/i1Q87Su.png) ![xymDXEI.png](https://i.imgur.com/xymDXEI.png)

Tale of Two Mers adds new variants of Elven and Orcish armor that can be exclusively found on Thalmor Soldiers and Stronghold Orcs.

[![Unique%20Horksbane.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreDespereaux/PierreDespereaux/master/assets/images/banners/Unique%20Horksbane.png)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42971)

![i1Q87Su.png](https://i.imgur.com/i1Q87Su.png) ![xymDXEI.png](https://i.imgur.com/xymDXEI.png)

A small tweak that gives Horksbane a unique model.

[![Pirate%20Wield%20Cutlasses.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreDespereaux/PierreDespereaux/master/assets/images/banners/Pirate%20Wield%20Cutlasses.png)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31753)

![i1Q87Su.png](https://i.imgur.com/i1Q87Su.png) ![xymDXEI.png](https://i.imgur.com/xymDXEI.png)

Pirates now wield Cutlasses!

![Miscellaneous.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreDespereaux/PierreDespereaux/master/assets/images/banners/Miscellaneous.png)

[![Daedric%20Shrines%20of%20Skyrim.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreDespereaux/PierreDespereaux/master/assets/images/banners/Daedric%20Shrines%20of%20Skyrim.png)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49366)

![i1Q87Su.png](https://i.imgur.com/i1Q87Su.png) ![xymDXEI.png](https://i.imgur.com/xymDXEI.png)

The Dragonborn DLC added shrines and blessings for both Azura and Boethiah to the game. However, these shrines are not present at these prince's holy places in Skyrim. This tiny mod adds a Shrine of Azura at the Shrine of Azura (go figure) and a Shrine of Boethiah at Sacellum of Boethiah.

[![Civil%20War%20Deserters.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreDespereaux/PierreDespereaux/master/assets/images/banners/Civil%20War%20Deserters.png)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44497)

![i1Q87Su.png](https://i.imgur.com/i1Q87Su.png) ![rpOp9g0.png](https://i.imgur.com/rpOp9g0.png) ![xymDXEI.png](https://i.imgur.com/xymDXEI.png)

Skyrim is a land ravaged by war, two sides duking it out for what they believe in. However, there are some who have become disenfranchised with the conflict and would rather just be left well alone. Now you will be able to encounter such people.

Keizaal is a simple modlist that seeks to enhance and expand on Skyrim without compromising Bethesda’s original vision that we all fell in love with back in 2011. The following are the core pillars of this list:

1. This modlist is lite and intends to maintain the Vanilla feel. A lot of the time modlists can become ridiculously huge and bloated, but this modlist wants to be nice and lean. Less is more.
2. Immersion is paramount. I’m a lore buff and immersion is very important to me. If a mod is not lore accurate or takes me out of the game in any way it will be excluded. Consistency also falls into this category, if a mod has a completely different aesthetic from Vanilla or any of my other mods then it will probably not be included.
3. Mods must have decent longevity. This modlist wants to be somewhat relevant, in theory, forever.
4. Stability is the most important thing. This rule basically supersedes all the above. If a mod introduces major stability concerns it will be quickly cut.
