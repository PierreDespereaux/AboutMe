# About Me

Hello all, my name is Pierre Despereaux and I am a Skyrim modder and Wabbajack modlist curator. I make a random mix of mods and don't really stay within any one category, just whatever I want to see added to the game. However, I am currently working on a larger project called "[Asya'la the Nordic Khajiit - A Fully Voiced Follower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbU1ubNYZbo)" alongside my wife, Cora Despereaux. I can't wait to share the finished project with you all!

In addition to my mods I also curate the [Keizaal](https://keizaal.github.io/Keizaal/) Wabbajack modlist. It is a simple modlist that seeks to enhance and expand on Skyrim without compromising Bethesdaâ€™s original vision that we all fell in love with back in 2011. If you're interested in learning more about Keizaal be sure to visit [the website](https://keizaal.github.io/Keizaal/).

I am not taking commission at this time.
