## About Me

Hello all, I am Pierre Despereaux and I am a Skyrim modder and Wabbajack modlist author. In the past I have focused mainly on on item integration mods such as Beyond Skyrim in Skyrim - An Integration Mod and Pirate's Life for Me - A Creation Club Integration Mod but I have recently moved on to more ambitious and complicated projects. Right now I am working on Asya'la the Nordic Khajiit - A Fully Voiced Follower mod alongside my wife, Cora Despereaux. I can't wait to share the finished project with you all!

In addition to my mods I also curate the Keizaal Wabbajack modlist. It is a simple modlist that seeks to enhance and expand on Skyrim without compromising Bethesda’s original vision that we all fell in love with back in 2011. If you're interested in learning more Keizaal be sure to visit the Wabbajack Discord server.
