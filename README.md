# About Me

Hello all, I am Pierre Despereaux and I am a Skyrim modder and Wabbajack modlist author. In the past I have focused mainly on on item integration mods such as [Beyond Skyrim in Skyrim - An Integration Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31787) and [Pirate's Life for Me - A Creation Club Integration Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35163) but I have recently moved on to more ambitious and complicated projects. Right now I am working on [Asya'la the Nordic Khajiit - A Fully Voiced Follower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbU1ubNYZbo) alongside my wife, Cora Despereaux. I can't wait to share the finished project with you all!

In addition to my mods I also curate the [Keizaal](https://pierredespereaux.github.io/Keizaal/) Wabbajack modlist. It is a simple modlist that seeks to enhance and expand on Skyrim without compromising Bethesdaâ€™s original vision that we all fell in love with back in 2011. If you're interested in learning more Keizaal be sure to visit the [Wabbajack Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/wabbajack).
